RAG and AI Agents Pipeline

Overview:
This project focuses on developing a robust pipeline for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrated with AI agents. The goal is to create an efficient system that combines the strengths of retrieval-based methods and generative models to produce accurate, contextually relevant responses for complex queries.

Features:
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Seamlessly integrates retrieval mechanisms with generative models to enhance the relevance and accuracy of responses.
AI Agent Coordination: Framework for efficient interaction and collaboration among AI agents to solve complex tasks.
Information Retrieval: Implements advanced retrieval strategies to extract relevant data from large datasets or knowledge bases.
Generative Modeling: Enhances AI models to generate coherent and context-aware content based on retrieved information.
Optimization: Continuous improvement of retrieval and generation processes using feedback loops and machine learning techniques.
